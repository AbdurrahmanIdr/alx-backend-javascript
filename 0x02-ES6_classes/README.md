## Introduction

In this project, we explore various concepts related to ES6 classes in JavaScript. From defining basic classes to implementing inheritance and advanced features, each task provides an opportunity to deepen our understanding of object-oriented programming principles in JavaScript.

## Tasks

The project consists of the following tasks:

1. Implementing a `ClassRoom` class.
2. Creating instances of `ClassRoom` objects.
3. Implementing a `HolbertonCourse` class with getters and setters.
4. Creating a `Currency` class with methods and static methods.
5. Defining a base `Building` class with abstract methods.
6. Extending the `Building` class to create a `SkyHighBuilding` subclass.
7. Developing an `Airport` class with default string description.
8. Creating a `HolbertonClass` class with type conversion methods.
9. Fixing a hoisting issue in class definitions.
10. Implementing a `Car` class with a clone method.
11. Extending the `Car` class to create an `EVCar` subclass.

## Setup

To run this project, ensure that you have Node.js (version ^12.11.x) installed on your system.

## Usage

```bash
node <filename.js>
```

## Testing

The project includes test cases written using Jest. To run the tests, execute the following command:

```bash
