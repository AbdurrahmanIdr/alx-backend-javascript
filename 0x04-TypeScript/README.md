## Introduction

The 0x04 TypeScript project is designed to familiarize developers with TypeScript, a statically typed superset of JavaScript that brings optional static types to your code. This project covers various TypeScript concepts such as basic types, interfaces, classes, functions, namespaces, generic types, ambient namespaces, declaration merging, and more.

## Tasks

The project is divided into multiple tasks, each focusing on specific TypeScript features and concepts. Here's a brief overview of each task:

1. **Creating an interface for a student**: Defines a Student interface and renders a table with student data.
2. **Let's build a Teacher interface**: Introduces the Teacher interface and supports adding additional attributes dynamically.
3. **Extending the Teacher class**: Extends the Teacher interface to include the Directors interface with additional attributes.
4. **Printing teachers**: Implements functions to print teacher details based on provided arguments.
5. **Writing a class**: Defines a StudentClass using TypeScript classes and interfaces.
6. **Advanced types Part 1**: Explores advanced TypeScript types, interfaces, and classes for different employee roles.
7. **String literal types**: Introduces string literal types and implements a function based on them.
8. **Ambient Namespaces**: Demonstrates the usage of ambient namespaces for importing external libraries and types.
9. **Namespace & Declaration merging**: Shows how to work with namespaces and declaration merging in TypeScript.
10. **Update task_4/js/main.ts**: Updates the main.ts file to include constants and objects for different subjects and teachers.
11. **Brand convention & Nominal typing**: Implements interfaces with brand properties for nominal typing.

## Installation

To install the project dependencies, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash

   ```bash
   cd alx-backend-javascript/0x04-TypeScript
   ```

3. Install dependencies using npm:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

Each task has its own directory containing the TypeScript files. You can navigate to each task directory to view and edit the code. The main.ts file in each task directory contains the TypeScript code to be executed.

## Testing

Testing is performed using Jest. To run the tests, use the following command:

```bash
npm test
```
